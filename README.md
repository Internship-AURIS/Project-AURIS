<h1>Project-AURIS</h1>
=============

AURIS stands for AUgmented Reality Interactive System 
and is a game which interacts with the ambience (edge-detection-collision) and 
the goal to move a projected ball to a specific position. <br>
Complete up to 9 levels to earn credits and spend them on new skins or try to beat
the programmer's highscore! ;) <br>
Keep your ball alive by not touching the edges of the screen and try to reach as many goals as you can to be the best in "AURIS"! :) <br>
